# Simple numerical solution of the wave equation

This notebook uses numpy and matplotlib packages.

First, a solution class is written. Then the initial conditions are defined. Then the solution is saved in numpy array u. Then all steps of the solution are plotted in a loop. Finally, this images are combined into a video file using [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/). An example of such solution is published on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/_aOYe9hcV10).
